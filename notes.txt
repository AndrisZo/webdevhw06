View of the game that's given to the browser side (state in our react code):

State stored in the socket:
:name: The name of the lobby that the user is in
:username: The name of the user

Calls the user can make to the server:
- "join"
    - Check for an ongoing game on the backup server
        - If there's an ongoing game, use it
        - If there's not, make a new one
    - view(addplayer(oldgame, name, namewinloss))
- "makeguess"
    - view(makeguess(oldgame, name, guess))
- "pass"
    - view(pass(oldgame, name))
- "ready-up"
    - readygame = readyup(game, name)
    - if everyone is ready:
        - view(startgame(game))
    - else 
        -view(game)
    - view(readyup(oldgame, name))
- "ready-down"
    - view(readydown(oldgame, name))
- "becomeplayer"
    - view(addplayer(oldgame, name, namewinloss))
- "becomeobserver"
    - push wins and losses to backup server
    - view(removeplayer(oldgame, name))
- "ping"
    - view(oldgame)
